# Whack-a-mole


## What is this?
This is a small arcade game written in two days using the **daScript** scripting language, for the 2021 daScript competition at **Gaijin**.

## How can it be run?
The game requires the [dasBox](https://github.com/imp5imp5/dasbox) sandbox. To make this repository self fontained, the **dasbox.exe** from [version 0.1.53](https://github.com/imp5imp5/dasbox/releases/tag/dasbox_portable_0_1_53) is included in this repository, so the game can be just started using **start.bat**.
